                In last five years, more than 450 students from marginalized areas have got jobs as Software Programs and have donated back more than 32 Lacs in donation. Together, these alumni are earning more than 16 crores a year are now instead tax-payers and job-creators. More than 1000 students are currently learning in residential centers across Bangalore, Pune, Delhi, Tripura, Amravati and Dharamsala.
                
                We have also started courses across different disciplines outside our flagship course on Software Programming. Few of the other courses launched are - School of Design, School of Media, School of Finance and School of Management. All of these are residential year-long courses with guaranteed jobs.
                
                25,000+ students have been taught basics of programming through our online application called Meraki - an app developed by NavGurukul alumni and volunteers.</em>

    CONCLUSION</h2>
    <P>
        We (navgurukul.org) run a one-year fully funded residential course for students from underrepresented communities to learn Software Engineering - get jobs (vocation!) and work towards the betterment of the surrounding communities (this is what we need, really - more problem solvers!). We have launched an online course and currently working with 2200+ learners. We have a capacity of 600 students in our residential centres (2 in Bangalore, 1 in Pune, 1 in Dharamshala), and are in process of adding another 600 seats through four different states by March 2022.<br>
        <br>So far we have placed around 150+ students in various companies including Mindtree, Thoughtworks, Unacademy, etc. and have a 100% placement rate for our students.<br><br>
